# youtube-mp3-downloader

This repo utilizes the `youtube_dl` library to download songs from youtube in bulk. To utilize this program open terminal and run the following command:

```
cd youtube-mp3-downloader
python downloader.py
```

The first run will create the necessary `Songs` directory and subsequent downloaded songs will be placed here. To add a list of songs to be downloaded, simply go to the newly created `queue.txt` file in `Songs` and paste the necessary youtube links in. Please only place one link per line and make sure to not have any extra spaces on the line.
